      Getting a good night’s sleep is essential for both physical and mental
      well-being. Here are some practical tips to help improve your sleep
      quality:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Establish a Routine</strong><br />
        Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends,
        helps regulate your internal clock. This makes it easier to fall asleep
        and wake up naturally.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment</strong> <br />Your bedroom
        should be cool, quiet, and dark. Invest in comfortable bedding, and
        consider blackout curtains or earplugs if necessary. The right
        environment encourages deep, restorative sleep.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Limit Screen Time Before Bed</strong> <br />The blue light
        emitted by phones, tablets, and TVs can interfere with your body’s
        production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep. Try to avoid
        screens at least an hour before bed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Watch What You Eat and Drink</strong> <br />Avoid heavy meals,
        caffeine, and alcohol in the hours leading up to bedtime. A light snack,
        like a banana or yogurt, can help if you’re hungry, but a full stomach
        might disrupt sleep.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Relax and Unwind</strong> <br />Engage in calming activities
        before bed, like reading, meditating, or taking a warm bath. A
        consistent wind-down routine helps signal to your body that it’s time to
        sleep.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Exercise Regularly</strong> <br />Regular physical activity can
        help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. However, avoid
        vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it may have the opposite effect.
      </li>
    </ol>

    Following these steps can lead to better sleep and, over time, improve your
    overall health and energy levels!
